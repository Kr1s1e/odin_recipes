            <li> 1 ounce dried chipotle chile pepper </li>
            <li> 1 ounce dried ancho chile pepper </li>
            <li> ½ cup water </li>
            <li> ½ red onion, cut into small chunks </li>
            <li> 4 cloves garlic </li>
            <li> 2 teaspoons sea salt </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon ground cumin </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon dried oregano </li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper </li>
            <li> 2 tablespoons olive oil </li>
            <li> 2 ½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Steps! </h3>
        <ol>
            <li> Place chipotle and ancho chile peppers in a shallow bowl; pour in water. Cover the bowl and let sit at room temperature until peppers are softened, 10 to 12 hours. Drain water and remove seeds from peppers.</li>
            <li> Blend chile peppers, red onion, garlic, sea salt, cumin, oregano, and black pepper in a blender until a coarse paste forms; add olive oil and blend until marinade is smooth.</li>
            <li> Place chicken thighs between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
            <li> Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag and add marinade. Turn chicken several times to coat. Seal bag and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours.</li>
            <li> Preheat an indoor grill with top and bottom plates for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li> Remove chicken from the bag and discard marinade (or store it in a jar for another time!).</li>
            <li> Place chicken on the preheated grill, close the lid, and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cut chicken into strips and serve warm. </li>
        </ul>

        <h3> Tips </h3>
        <ul>
            <li> If you do not have an indoor electric grill, wrap a paver brick in aluminum foil and place it on top of the chicken to keep it flat while cooking on an outdoor grill. </li>
            <li> Soak chile peppers in broth instead of water, if desired </li>
        </ul>
